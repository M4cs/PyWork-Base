# PyWork Base
***Currently under active development. This is a very early design. Much to come from what you see now.***

### What is PyWork Base?

PyWork Base is a framework base that I use in many programs. It is a very easy template to build off and customize.
You can see applications of it in projects such as [DarkSpiritz](https://github.com/DarkSpiritz/DarkSpiritz), [BabySploit](https://github.com/M4cs/BabySploit), and [NaviSat](https://github.com/M4cs/NaviSat).
It offers an easy way to control configuration files, add modules, customize the UI, and add commands. 

### Documentation
Most documentation is written in the code itself. This will most likely stay this way until I get everything implemented.

### Usage
Feel free to use this in your own project. All I ask is you credit it somehow. Literally anywhere doesn't matter as long as you do it. Also per
license include that as well. Enjoy!
