# PyWork Base
***Currently under active development. This is a very early design. Much to come from what you see now.***

### What is PyWork Base?

PyWork Base is a framework base that I use in many programs. It is a very easy template to build off and customize.
You can see applications of it in projects such as [DarkSpiritz](https://github.com/DarkSpiritz/DarkSpiritz), [BabySploit](https://github.com/M4cs/BabySploit), and [NaviSat](https://github.com/M4cs/NaviSat).
It offers an easy way to control configuration files, add modules, customize the UI, and add commands. 

### Compatibility

PyWork Base is mainly geared to work on Linux systems. It doesn't take much to make it work on Windows apart from reading paths differently. You should be able to just remove anything to do with the `fabulous` module and be able to run it on Windows AFAIK. If you have any issues let me know through an Issue or [Discord](https://discord.gg/NjxjCQQ)

### Documentation
Most documentation is written in the code itself. This will most likely stay this way until I get everything implemented.

### Usage
Feel free to use this in your own project. All I ask is you credit it somehow. Literally anywhere doesn't matter as long as you do it. Also per
license include that as well. Enjoy!
